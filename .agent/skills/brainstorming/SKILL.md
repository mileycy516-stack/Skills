# Brainstorming

## Overview

Turn rough ideas into fully formed designs and specs through natural collaborative dialogue. Focus on understanding the "why" and "how" before jumping into the "what".

## The Process

### 1. Understanding Intent
- Ask one question at a time to refine the idea.
- Focus on purpose, constraints, and success criteria.
- Prefer multiple choice or specific options to reduce cognitive load.

### 2. Exploring Approaches
- Propose 2-3 different approaches with clear trade-offs.
- Recommend one approach and explain why it's the best fit for the context.

### 3. Presenting the Design
- Present the design in small sections (200-300 words).
- Validate each section with the user before moving to the next.
- Cover architecture, components, data flow, and testing strategy.

## Key Principles

- **One Question at a Time**: Don't overwhelm the user.
- **Incremental Validation**: Get feedback at every step.
- **Ruthless YAGNI**: Focus only on what is necessary.
- **Socratic Refinement**: Use questions to tease out the best design.

## After the Design

Once the design is validated:
- Document it in `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-design.md`.
- Commit the design document.
- Ask: "Ready to move to the planning phase?" 
- Transition to the `planning` skill to break the design into actionable tasks.
