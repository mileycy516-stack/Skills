# Brand Identity & Guidelines

**Brand Name:** [INSERT BRAND NAME HERE]

This skill defines the core constraints for visual design and technical implementation for the brand. You must adhere to these guidelines strictly to maintain consistency.

## When to use this skill
- Generating UI components or styling applications
- Writing marketing copy, error messages, or documentation
- Choosing libraries or defining technical constraints
- Creating user-facing assets that need to match the brand

## Workflow
1. **Identify the Task Context**: Determine if you are designing (Visuals), coding (Tech), or writing (Voice).
2. **Consult Resources**: Use the specific files in `resources/` for exact values and rules.
3. **Implement**: Apply the constraints strictly. Do not guess or deviate without explicit user instruction.
