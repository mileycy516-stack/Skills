# Cognitive Reframing & Probabilistic Thinking

Based on Mark Douglas ("Trading in the Zone") and Stoic Principles.

## 1. The 5 Fundamental Truths
Write these down. Read them before every session.
1.  **Anything can happen.** (Accept the unknown).
2.  **You don't need to know what is going to happen next to make money.** (You trigger an edge, not a prediction).
3.  **There is a random distribution between wins and losses** for any given set of variables that define an edge. (Win/Loss/Win/Win/Loss... is random).
4.  **An edge is nothing more than a higher probability** of one thing happening over another.
5.  **Every moment in the market is unique.** (This trade is not the last trade. Don't carry baggage).

## 2. Reframing Exercises

### The "Sample Size" Reframe
*   **Bad Thought**: "I lost. I was wrong. My system is broken."
*   **Reframe**: "I am executing a 20-trade block. This was trade #1. The outcome of #1 is irrelevant. Only the outcome of the block matters."
*   **Action**: Don't check PnL until the 20-trade sample is complete.

### The "Casino" Reframe
*   **Bad Thought**: "I hope this works."
*   **Reframe**: "I am the House. The Setup is the slot machine. I just let the player (Order Flow) pull the lever. Sometimes they win, but over time, the House always wins."

### The "Cost of Business" Reframe
*   **Bad Thought**: "I lost $500. That's a nice dinner / car payment."
*   **Reframe**: "My inventory is Risk. I bought $500 worth of information. The market told me 'Not now'. It was a valid business expense."
