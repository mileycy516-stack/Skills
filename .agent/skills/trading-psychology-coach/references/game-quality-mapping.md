# Game Quality Mapping (A/B/C Game)

You cannot fix a problem you cannot see. Map your performance levels to detect degradation early.

## A-Game (The Zone) ~ 10-20% of time
*   **Mental State**: Calm, Objective, Patient, "Time slows down".
*   **Physical State**: Relaxed shoulders, steady breathing, light grip on mouse.
*   **Trading Behaviors**:
    *   Waiting for A+ setups.
    *   Accepting stops instantly.
    *   Adding to winners.
    *   Zero hesitation.

## B-Game (The Baseline) ~ 60% of time
*   **Mental State**: Focused but conscious effort. Thinking about the PnL occasionally.
*   **Physical State**: Slight tension.
*   **Trading Behaviors**:
    *   Taking B+ setups.
    *   Maybe exiting a bit early.
    *   Following rules, but feeling the friction.
    *   **Goal**: Maintain B-Game. Don't slip to C.

## C-Game (The Tilt) ~ 20% of time
*   **Mental State**: "I need to win", "This isn't fair", Foggy, Tunneled Vision.
*   **Physical State**: Clenched jaw, sweating, pounding heart, slamming mouse.
*   **Trading Behaviors (The Leaks)**:
    *   Moving Stop Loss.
    *   Doubling down on losers (Martingale).
    *   Revenge trading immediately after loss.
    *   FOMO entering at highs.

## Protocol
1.  **Rate Yourself**: Every 30 mins, rate your game (A/B/C).
2.  **The Hard Rule**: If you detect **ANY** C-Game signal (e.g., "I swore at the screen"), you **MUST** stop execution. Stand up. Reset.
