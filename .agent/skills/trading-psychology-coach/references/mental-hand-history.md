# Mental Hand History Template

Based on Jared Tendler's protocol. Use this whenever you feel an intense emotion or make a mistake.

**Goal**: Logic doesn't work on emotions. Writing moves the processing from the Amygdala (Emotion) to the Prefrontal Cortex (Logic).

## 1. Trigger (The Signal)
*What just happened?*
> Example: "I took a loss on a setup that looked perfect." / "Price moved 1 tick from my target and reversed."

## 2. Emotion (The Alarm)
*What are you feeling?*
> Example: "Rage." / "Injustice." / "Desire to get even." / "Paralyzing fear."

## 3. Thought Process (The Bias)
*What are you telling yourself?*
> Example: "They are hunting my stops." / "I can't believe I was so stupid." / "I need to make this back now or I'm a failure."

## 4. The Flaw (The Root Cause)
*Why is that thought irrational?*
> Example: "There is no 'They'. The market is an aggregation of flow. A loss is just cost of goods sold. One trade determines nothing."

## 5. The Correction (The Truth)
*What is the probabilistic reality?*
> Example: "I executed the plan. The outcome was random. Over 100 trades, this edge wins. I accept the uncertainty."

## 6. Logic Injection (The Mantra)
*One sentence to reset focus.*
> Example: "Next trade." / "Process over Outcome." / "I pay for information with risk."
