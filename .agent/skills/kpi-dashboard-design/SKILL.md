# KPI Dashboard Design

Comprehensive patterns for designing effective Key Performance Indicator (KPI) dashboards that drive business decisions.

## When to Use This Skill
- Designing executive, tactical, or operational dashboards.
- Selecting meaningful KPIs for Sales, Marketing, Product, or Finance.
- Building real-time monitoring displays.
- Visualizing data patterns (Cohorts, Trends).

## Core Concepts

### 1. KPI Framework
| Level | Focus | Update Frequency | Audience |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategic** | Long-term goals | Monthly/Quarterly | Executives |
| **Tactical** | Department goals | Weekly/Monthly | Managers |
| **Operational** | Day-to-day | Real-time/Daily | Teams |

### 2. SMART KPIs
*   **Specific**: Clear definition.
*   **Measurable**: Quantifiable.
*   **Achievable**: Realistic targets.
*   **Relevant**: Aligned to goals.
*   **Time-bound**: Defined period.

### 3. Dashboard Hierarchy
1.  **Executive Summary**: 4-6 Headline KPIs.
2.  **Department Views**: Specific dashboards (Sales, Ops).
3.  **Drilldowns**: Individual metrics & Root Cause Analysis.

## Best Practices
*   **Do**: Limit to 5-7 KPIs per view. Use consistent status colors (Red/Green).
*   **Don't**: Use vanity metrics. Use 3D charts. Overcrowd the UI.
