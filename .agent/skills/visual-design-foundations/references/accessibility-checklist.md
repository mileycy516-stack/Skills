# Visual Accessibility / Contrast Checklist

## Contrast Ratios (WCAG 2.1)
- [ ] **Body Text**: 4.5:1 ratio against background.
- [ ] **Large Text (18pt+ or 14pt bold)**: 3:1 ratio.
- [ ] **UI Components (Buttons, Inputs)**: 3:1 ratio against background.
- [ ] **Icons**: Essential icons must meet 3:1 ratio.

## Color Blindness
- [ ] **Don't rely on color only**: Add text labels or icons for status (e.g., Error is Red, but also has an "X" icon or "Error:" text).
- [ ] **Link Underscores**: Keep links underlined within body text blocks.

## Dark Mode
- [ ] **Avoid usage of pure black (#000000)**: Use dark gray (#121212 etc) to reduce eye strain (smearing on OLEDs).
- [ ] **Desaturate colors**: Bright saturated colors vibrate on dark backgrounds. Use lighter, pastel variants (Blue-500 -> Blue-400).
